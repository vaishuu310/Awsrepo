1. launch
2.connect 
next,connect to the instance,you can connect to the instance in serval ways.your progrsmd snd applications have multiple different methods to connect directly to the instance and exchange data. 
users can also connect to the instance by logging in and accessing the commputer desktop.

CDN--content delivary network

SIMPLE NOTIFICATION SERVICE (SNS) --


SIMPLE QUEUE SERVICE (SQS) -- Is used to connect one service to another.


elastic conturnisation  service (ECS)--

elastic qubernate service (EQS)

* VPC-- virtual private cloud -- is the space ,it is private network and it contain internal gateway(IG) 
we use to establish boundaries around your AWS resources is amazon virtual private cloud (Amazon VPC).

* Inbound and outbound networks pass through IG only.
*subnet means network inside network. is a section of VPC in which you can group resources based on security or operational needs.
subnet can be public or private.
* EC2 instances and ELBs inside of your VPC, amazon VPC anables you to provision an isolated section of the AWS cloud.
* AWS direct connect is a service that enables you to establish a dedicated private connection between your data center and a VPC.

*networks are three types--
1. private network (0-1% secure)
2.VPN(virtual private Network)-50% secure
3.AWS direct network -100% secure

*ACL--aceess control link
A network access control list is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound trafic at the subnet level. stateless packet filtering-network ACLs perform stateless packet filtering,they remeber nothing and check packets that cross the subnet border each way: inbound and outbound.

* Issues- Multiple people cant use same project at a time to solve it we use VCT.
* VCT --> version controll tools 
* Version control- this is the practice which helps us to manage the changes in the project and source code,this process is called as version controll tools.
Ex- Git, Bit Bucket,AWS code commit,Git lab etc..,

* GIT -->It is open source remote repository tool.
- Remote Repository - In github.com we will create a remote repository
- Local repository - It will pull to remote repository.
To get a data from remote repository to local repository wee use clone.
